TV Shows I watch. Somewhat in order of preference. 
- The Wire: Great characters, shows all sides of the Baltimore drug scene.
  Actually feeling disappointed with a character, good stuff.
- Westworld: awesomely complex, rich in details. Stay awake and every detail
  matters
- Breaking bad: Magnets, bitch
- Game of Thrones: Fighting, backstabbing, politics. Don't get attached to any
  character
- The Expanse: Elite Dangerous, space politics, feels Babylon 5ey except no
  Zooty
- Banshee: Violent. Best enjoyed with a whisky
- The Blacklist: Like a fine anecdote I once heared in Maui... Series is in
  a rut, still fun
- Grey's Anatomy: guilty pleasure
- House: Gets samey but House's character appeals to me. 
- Dexter: First season was excellent, it quickly wore off
