TV Shows I watch. Somewhat in order of preference. 
- The Wire: Great characters, shows all sides of the Baltimore drug scene.
  Actually feeling disappointed with a character, good stuff.
- Westworld: awesomely complex, rich in details. Stay awake and every detail
  matters.
- Breaking bad: From science teacher to drug kingpin.
- Game of Thrones: Fighting, backstabbing, politics. Don't get attached to any
  character.
- The Expanse: Elite Dangerous, space politics
- Mr. Robot: Hackers, evil corp, mental issues, and drug abuse.
- Grey's Anatomy: guilty pleasure.
- Defiance: Babylon 5 on earth.
- Banshee: Violent. Best enjoyed with a whisky.
- The Blacklist: Started off fun, is now repetitive really.
- House: Gets samey but House's character appeals to me.
- Dexter: First season was excellent, it quickly wore off.
