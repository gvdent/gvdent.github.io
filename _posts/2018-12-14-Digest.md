[Two images of the miners' strike, an instant apart: so which is the classic?](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/06/photographers-scrum-winning-image-picture)[hn]( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18623286)

Awesome shots highlighting the different stories told by slight difference in
time (and framing in the hn comments).

[SQL style guide](http://www.sqlstyle.guide/)[hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12671667)

I love reading syle guides for (programming) languages I work with. It offers
insight into how other think about readable code, and provokes internal
discussion about my own style.


[Taking Children Seriously](http://fallibleideas.com/taking-children-seriously)[hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15836698)

One constant of hackernews: the discussion on it is often as interesting or
moreso than the original article. Also one of the few parenting things I'll
link on here, because I do not read up on that as voraciously.


[Show HN: Guitar Dashboard â€“ Open source music theory explorer for guitarists](http://guitardashboard.com/)[hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17987657)

I don't understand much/any of this but I hope this will be useful to me at
some point
