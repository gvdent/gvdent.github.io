So
[another](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/op-ed-game-companies-need-to-cut-the-crap-loot-boxes-are-obviously-gambling/)([hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17175941))
thread popped up on my radar regarding loot boxes. This has been a hot topic
the past... timeframe, with FIFA 18 potentially banned in the Netherlands
because of them. I have quit Hearthstone because of them being so core to the
gameplay. The distinction between whether a game is free-to-play or not does
not really make much of a difference, games should be played to enjoy. When
a games require engaging in acts of gambling to achieve power, it can't really
hold my interest anymore. Personally I can't be bothered to put the hours in
anymore, and spending money on the games makes me feel like I have to spend
time on them as well, but that may just be me getting old.

This quote rings so true to me. As soon as behavioural science comes into
any form of entertainment (and I use the term broadly here) to attempt to
change how a user interacts with the system, it just seems to break down.
Optimizing user engagement seems to be a euphemism for creating addicts.
