title: Back to the guitar
---

Some 20 years ago I used to play guitar, which stopped after I moved out to
attend university. Much of it has slipped my memory, but there are still some
chords which just feel natural.

When my daughter expressed interest in playing, naturally I would be the one to
teach her at least initially. With kids you never know if it will stick. Or
with me for that matter; I have a tendency to get excited about things and then
suddenly drop them completely.

So off to find some teaching resources. Everyone on the internet
([reddit](https://reddit.com/r/guitar) really) was talking about this guy
called [Justin](https://www.justinguitar.com/) so I check it out and got hooked
again! This guy is an amazing teacher <3
