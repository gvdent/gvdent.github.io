This morning I read an interesting post on [net neutrality](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/inside-the-invisible-war-for-the-open-internet-dd31a29a3f08),
in which the second image seemed like a bit too real of ad advert we might see in
the future. The post breaks down the issue and provides history of similar
trends in the past as well.
