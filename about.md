Welcome! This page is meant as my dumping grounds for thoughts, links, and
various other things which I find of interest.

This page mosly started as an experiment on github pages, and a desire to go
beyond the walled gardens that are other social networks. This entire page
resides in a a [git repository](https://github.com/gvdent/gvdent.github.io),
which is a fork from Jekyll Now.
